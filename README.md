# My Vim configuration

## Installation

Install by cloning the repository to `~/.vim` like so:

```
git clone git@github.com:ArnaudLevaufre/Vim.git ~/.vim
```

Starting vim will install vim-plug and run `:PlugInstall` to install all
required plugins automatically. You may need to restart vim in order for the
configuration to be correctly applied with all newly installed plugins.

## Recommendation

I do not recommend using this configuration directly. It will not suit your
need. It's best to start with an empty configuration and build a configuration
you like by yourself. However, I strongly encourage you to take a look at my
(and other's) vimrc to find helpful configuration and plugins you may like. Use
the built-in vim help command to know more about individual configurations.
